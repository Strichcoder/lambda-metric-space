lambda-metric-space, a Lean project

# The Lean Theorem prover
Lean is a proof assistant and mathlib is a large mathematical library for Lean, in which notions and proofs for a large part of the undergraduate curriculum has been formalized.

In this project, we build on the already present notion of ordered ablian groups, to formalize the definition of Λ-metric spaces and Λ-trees, an excellent introduction to which can be found in Ian Chiswell's book 'Introduction ot Λ-trees'.

As an application we formalize some results from the excellent 'Introduction to Λ-trees' by Ian Chiswell and from a paper '(In)dependence of the axioms of Λ-trees' by the author.

To be precise, we formalize
- Lemma 3.6 from Chiswell's book, (Lemma 2 in the paper).
- Lemma 4 in the paper.
- The main direction (a) implies (b) of Theorem 1 in the paper.
